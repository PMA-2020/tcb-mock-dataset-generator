"""Create new PMA TCB skill dataset

TODO: This is not yet implemented. However, it should be fast to implement
 by altering the "run" function of the "create_new_tidy_dataset" module
 to take another boolean param, where based on the param value, instead of
 saving a CSV, the run function will instead return the result. Then, the
 result can be piped to the "tidy_to_skill" module.
